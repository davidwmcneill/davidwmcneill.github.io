What is GitOps and why do I need it? Just another buzzword? I personally don&amp;rsquo;t think so.
To Quote from WeaveWorks:
GitOps works by using Git as a single source of truth for declarative infrastructure and applications. With GitOps, the use of software agents can alert on any divergence between Git with what&amp;rsquo;s running in a cluster, and if there&amp;rsquo;s a difference, Kubernetes reconcilers automatically update or rollback the cluster depending on the case.</description></item><item><title>K3d + ArgoCD = Local GitOps</title><link>https://davidwmcneill.github.io/posts/k3d-argocd/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidwmcneill.github.io/posts/k3d-argocd/</guid><description>The pre-ramble A quick look at what ArgoCD and K3d are&amp;hellip;

Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes.

FluxCD What is K3d
k3d is a lightweight wrapper to run k3s (Rancher Labâ€™s minimal Kubernetes distribution) in docker.

Kind Minikube The idea I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with ArgoCD in production for a few years now and it is in my opinion the biggest game changer in terms of Kubernetes continuous delivery management.</description></item></channel></rss>
