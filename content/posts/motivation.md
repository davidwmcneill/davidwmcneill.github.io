Typically I track my technical note taking using [Notion](https://www.notion.so/product). This works well as a personal wiki for everything I learn where the smaller details are likely to slip out of my brain in the future!

The premise of this blog is to build on these notes with a more formal summary for future reference (and hopefully help sharpen my knowledge on the subject matter)

In some way this is inspired by the many hours spent reading on [medium](https://medium.com/)
