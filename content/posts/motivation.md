Typically I track my technical note taking using [Notion](https://www.notion.so/product). This works well as a personal wiki for everything I learn where the smaller details are likely to slip out of my brain in the future!

The premise of this blog is to build on these notes with a more formal summary for future reference (and hopefully help sharpen my knowledge on the subject matter). I've found this to be the most effective way to learn and recall a subject in more detail. This is know as '[The Feynman Learning Technique](https://fs.blog/2021/02/feynman-learning-technique/).

This technique can be simplified as:

1) Identify the subject you want to understand
2) Write an explanation as if you are teaching it to someone who didn't understand the subject
3) Identify the gaps in your knowledge - Research further and compile the information
4) Organize - simplify + tell the story (write the blog post!)
